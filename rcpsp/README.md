# Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem

## Description
A Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) considers resources of limited availability and activities of known durations and resource requests, linked by precedence relations. The problem consists of finding a schedule of minimal duration by assigning a start time to each activity such that the precedence
relations and the resource availabilities are respected.
